The task: Airport (ADT: priority queue, long integer).
The airport has 1 runway, landing planes have priority, i.e. if the runway is free, the landing aircraft is received first, 
but if some plane started to take off, then all other planes, including those that want to land, must wait, a plane that wants to land can't wait very long because it will run out of fuel.
Purpose: to investigate at which load one runway is sufficient for the airport.

Initial data:
1) landing time (duration),
2) takeoff time (duration),
3) the amount of time the aircraft wanting to land can still be in the air,
4) the probability that a plane wants to take off/land at the current moment (possible implementation: generating a random number and checking whether it satisfies a certain condition),
5) landing and takeoff planes appear with equal probability.

Results: 
1) Plane Crashed (simulation ends immediately),
2) the maximum and average waiting time for a plane that wants to land,
3) maximum and average waiting time for a plane to take off.
